# Automated GILDAS-CLASS Pipeline

Python pipeline to use GILDAS-CLASS in an automated way. It consists of five Python 3 scripts (`classpipeline.py`, `classlinesearch.py`, `classreduction.py`, `classaverage.py`, `classcombine.py`) and two optional Julia scripts (`classlinesearch.jl`, `classreduction.jl`).

This software allows to use the package CLASS from the software GILDAS, by IRAM, in an automated way. You can check the user guide ([`automated-gildas-class-pipeline-userguide.pdf`](https://github.com/andresmegias/gildas-class-python/blob/main/automated/gildas-class-pipeline-userguide.pdf)) and the example files (inside the `example` folder) to learn how to use it.
